In 2015 took part in an audio themed Hackathon put on by This American Life and ThoughtWorks.

My team developed a tool that allows a user to select a short clip from a podcast and create a video incorporating the audio, transcript, and a visualization that can be shared over Twitter.

This project became the inspiration for a fully developed tool from This American Life, Shortcut!
