A good friend of mine needed a web presence to show off her amazing custom cakes and baked treats, so I built her one.

In 2017, we updated to use a cleaner, responsive site that put the focus on her products.  By switching from a custom built and hosted site to Square Space she is now able to easily make changes and add new content without needing my help.
